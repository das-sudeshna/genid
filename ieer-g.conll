What	O

Then	O
,	O
inspired	O

Searching	O
for	O
the	O

of	O
that	O

he	O
decided	O
to	O
frame	O
the	O
opera	O
with	O
lighting	O
and	O
to	O
present	O
it	O
in	O
a	O
simple	O

anything	O

What	O
is	O
the	O

it	O
that	O

is	O
it	O
the	O

way	O
around	O

Women	O
may	O
complain	O
of	O
a	O
lack	O

because	O
it	O
is	O
more	O

some	O
very	O
good	O

However	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
truism	O
that	O
national	O

are	O
only	O
available	O
to	O
the	O

that	O
there	O
is	O

is	O
not	O

And	O
the	O
issue	O
is	O
not	O
just	O
financial	O

It	O

In	O

,	O
President	O
Boris	M
Yeltsin	M
summoned	O
his	O
opponents	O
to	O
the	O
Kremlin	O
Tuesday	O

an	O

that	O

prime	O

sat	O

The	O

captured	O
Yeltsin	M
as	O
he	O
served	O
notice	O
to	O
his	O
critics	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
no	O
intention	O
of	O
abandoning	O
Kiriyenko	M
.	O

After	O
projecting	O
an	O
image	O
of	O
strength	O
,	O
Yeltsin	M
portrayed	O
himself	O
as	O
a	O
reasonable	O
leader	O
who	O
would	O
try	O
to	O
work	O
with	O
the	O
Communist	O
-	O
dominated	O
lower	O
house	O
of	O
parliament	O
.	O

But	O
the	O
meeting	O
itself	O
was	O
something	O
less	O
than	O
definitive	O

the	O
back	O

over	O
the	O
Kiriyenko	M
nomination	O

on	O

I	O
think	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
purely	O
cosmetic	O
event	O
,	O
said	O
Yevgeny	M
Volk	M
,	O
the	O
director	O
of	O
the	O
Moscow	O
office	O
of	O
the	O
Heritage	O
Foundation	O
.	O

What	O
we	O
are	O
talking	O
about	O
is	O
bargaining	O
.	O

In	O
tactical	O
terms	O
,	O
Yeltsin	M
conducted	O
a	O
round	O
table	O
so	O
that	O
the	O
Communists	O
and	O
nationals	O
could	O
say	O
their	O
pressure	O
on	O
the	O
government	O
had	O
been	O
answered	O
.	O

Volk	M
,	O
however	O
,	O
expressed	O
the	O
dominant	O
view	O
in	O
Moscow	O
that	O
Yeltsin	M
would	O
ultimately	O
succeed	O
in	O
winning	O
parliamentary	O
approval	O
of	O
Kiriyenko	M
'	O
s	O
appointment	O
.	O

Indeed	O
,	O
the	O
key	O
question	O
increasingly	O
appears	O
to	O
be	O
not	O
whether	O
Kiriyenko	M
will	O
be	O
approved	O
but	O
what	O
the	O
cost	O
will	O
be	O
in	O
terms	O
of	O
symbolic	O
or	O
substantive	O
concessions	O
by	O
Yeltsin	M
in	O
new	O
appointments	O
or	O
programs	O
.	O

To	O
be	O
sure	O
,	O
Yeltsin	M
was	O
not	O
the	O
only	O
one	O
striking	O
poses	O

Gennadi	M
Zyuganov	M
,	O
the	O
communist	O
leader	O
,	O
declared	O
after	O
the	O
meeting	O
that	O
the	O
Communists	O
would	O
not	O
back	O
Kiriyenko	M
'	O
s	O
appointment	O
when	O
his	O
nomination	O
comes	O
before	O
Parliament	O
on	O
Friday	O
.	O

But	O
that	O
does	O
not	O
mean	O
that	O
the	O
Communists	O
are	O
determined	O
to	O
block	O
the	O
nomination	O
indefinitely	O
.	O

Many	O
political	O
analysts	O
believe	O
that	O
the	O
Communists	O
are	O
determined	O
to	O
appear	O
resolute	O
before	O
a	O
national	O
day	O
of	O
protest	O
scheduled	O
for	O
Thursday	O
.	O

And	O
Zyuganov	M
was	O
careful	O
not	O
to	O
exclude	O
the	O
possibility	O
that	O

might	O
