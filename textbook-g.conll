Patric	M

encouraged	O
Ross	M
not	O

in	O

Ross	M
then	O
hypothesised	O
that	O
the	O

the	O

the	O

There	O
was	O
an	O

Ravi	M
beat	O
up	O
Samba	M

broke	O

The	O

A	O

Kranthi	M
took	O

They	O
showed	O

At	O

Kranthi	M

went	O

began	O
his	O
investigation	O
by	O
examining	O
the	O
injuries	O
suffered	O
by	O
Samba	M

Then	O
he	O
questioned	O
Ravi	M

neighbours	O

This	O
established	O
beyond	O
doubt	O
that	O
Samba	M
was	O
assaulted	O
and	O
injured	O
by	O
Ravi	M
.	O

He	O
arrested	O
Ravi	M
and	O
took	O
him	O
to	O
the	O
Mandal	O
Police	O
Station	O
and	O
questioned	O
him	O
there	O
.	O

Ravi	M
flatly	O
denied	O
ever	O
assaulting	O
Samba	M

They	O
tried	O
hard	O
to	O
make	O
Ravi	M
accept	O
his	O
offence	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
stuck	O
to	O
his	O
denial	O
.	O

Ravi	M
was	O
detained	O
in	O
the	O

,	O
so	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
be	O
produced	O
before	O
the	O

,	O
the	O
next	O

Samba	M
thought	O
that	O
the	O

arrested	O
Ravi	M
to	O
punish	O
him	O
for	O
the	O
crime	O

The	O

I	O

I	O
will	O

If	O

The	O

Ravi	M

Finally	O

the	O

judgement	O
that	O
Ravi	M
was	O
guilty	O
and	O
sentenced	O
him	O

Ravi	M
was	O
unhappy	O
with	O
the	O
judgment	O

Ravi	M
s	O
lawyer	O
advised	O
him	O
to	O
file	O
an	O
appeal	O
in	O

in	O

You	O

to	O
me	O
.	O

Ravi	M
was	O
still	O
worried	O
.	O

The	O
lawyer	O
assured	O
him	O
that	O
the	O
case	O
in	O
the	O
session	O
s	O
court	O
would	O
require	O
not	O
more	O
than	O
one	O
or	O
two	O
hearings	O
in	O
which	O
Ravi	M
would	O
have	O
to	O
be	O
present	O
.	O

Ravi	M
s	O
lawyer	O
appealed	O
to	O
the	O
session	O
s	O
court	O
on	O
his	O
behalf	O
.	O

This	O
meant	O
that	O
Ravi	M
did	O
not	O
have	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
jail	O
immediately	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
court	O
Ravi	M
had	O
to	O
appear	O
only	O
once	O
.	O

Samba	M
and	O
their	O
witnesses	O
need	O
not	O
appear	O
.	O

Ravi	M
was	O
held	O
guilty	O
but	O
his	O
punishment	O
was	O
reduced	O
by	O
a	O
year	O
.	O

Can	O
you	O
think	O
of	O
the	O
reasons	O
why	O
the	O
session	O
s	O
court	O
may	O
have	O
reduced	O
Ravi	M
s	O
punishment	O
?	O

Ravi	M
was	O
not	O
happy	O
with	O
the	O
judgement	O
of	O
the	O
session	O
s	O
court	O
also	O
.	O

Ravi	M
paid	O
some	O
more	O
fees	O
to	O
his	O
lawyer	O
and	O
asked	O
him	O
to	O
appeal	O
to	O
the	O
High	O
Court	O
.	O

Ravi	M
therefore	O
lost	O
the	O
case	O
in	O
the	O
High	O
Court	O
and	O
had	O
to	O
suffer	O
the	O
penalty	O
given	O
to	O
him	O
by	O
the	O
session	O
s	O
court	O
.	O

Now	O
Ravi	M
has	O
only	O
two	O
ways	O
;	O
one	O
is	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
jail	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
is	O
to	O
appeal	O
to	O
the	O
Supreme	O
Court	O

Ravi	M
was	O
quite	O
tired	O
and	O
weary	O
of	O
the	O
whole	O
affair	O
by	O

that	O

Darwin	M

the	O

out	O
in	O

so	O
Newton	M
took	O
a	O

This	O
incident	O
prompted	O
Newton	M
to	O
explore	O
the	O
possibility	O
of	O
connecting	O
gravity	O
with	O
the	O
force	O
that	O
kept	O
the	O

Newton	M

Newton	M
was	O
also	O
a	O

transformed	O

into	O
a	O

it	O

It	O
is	O
important	O

that	O
Kepler	M
could	O
not	O
give	O
a	O
theory	O
to	O
explain	O

was	O

that	O

is	O
the	O

Your	O

Yes	O

The	O
work	O
of	O
Gregor	M

was	O
crucial	O
in	O

To	O
study	O
genetics	O
,	O
Mendel	M
chose	O
to	O
work	O
with	O
pea	O
plants	O
because	O
they	O
have	O
easily	O
identifiable	O
traits	O
.	O

Mendel	M
studied	O
the	O
inheritance	O
patterns	O
for	O
many	O

traits	O
in	O

round	O
seeds	O

white	O

In	O
one	O

early	O
experiments	O

he	O
crossed	O
a	O

time	O

observed	O
that	O

Next	O
