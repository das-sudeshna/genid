And	O
so	O

The	O
origin	O
of	O
Agotes	O
(	O
or	O
Cagots	O

is	O
uncertain	O

It	O
has	O
been	O
suggested	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
descendants	O
of	O
the	O
Visigoths	O
,	O
and	O
somebody	O
derives	O
the	O
name	O
from	O
caas	O
(	O
dog	O
)	O
and	O
Goth	O
.	O

But	O
opposed	O
to	O
this	O
etymology	O
is	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
the	O
word	O
"	O

first	O

in	O
this	O

French	O
historian	O

Marca	M
(	O
16th	O
century	O
)	O
,	O
in	O
his	O
Histoire	O
de	O
Beam	O
,	O
holds	O
that	O
the	O
word	O
signifies	O
hunters	O
of	O
the	O
Goths	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
Cagots	O
are	O
descendants	O
of	O
the	O
Saracens	O
.	O

Others	O
made	O
them	O
descendants	O
of	O
the	O
Albigenses	O
.	O

A	O
far	O
more	O
probable	O
explanation	O
of	O
their	O
name	O
Christians	O
is	O
to	O
be	O
found	O
in	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
in	O
medieval	O
times	O
all	O
lepers	O
were	O
known	O
as	O
pauperes	O
Christi	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
Goths	O
or	O
not	O
,	O
these	O
Cagots	O
were	O
affected	O
in	O
the	O
Middle	O

with	O
a	O
particular	O
form	O
of	O
leprosy	O
or	O
a	O
condition	O
resembling	O
it	O

Thus	O
would	O
arise	O
the	O
confusion	O
between	O
Christians	O
and	O
Cretins	O

It	O
was	O
not	O

With	O

What	O
Hitzig	M

had	O
discovered	O
is	O
that	O
electrical	O
stimulation	O

In	O
1870	O
Hitzig	M
published	O
his	O
findings	O
in	O
an	O
essay	O
called	O
"	O
On	O
the	O

Hitzig	M

that	O

Apparently	O
Hitzig	M
